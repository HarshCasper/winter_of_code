# Winter of Code

## About The Program

Winter of Code is a program aimed to increase participation for the Google Summer of Code program among students in colleges and universities.
Winter of Code is here to light up your winter spirits with the wide world of open source development. This initiative aims to prepare you for the grand Google Summer of Code. Join us for a month-long programming project with an open-source organization.

As a part of the Winter of Code, students are paired with mentors from the participating organisation. This initiative aims at developing your skills in real-world software development in a wide range of specializations. In turn, the participating organisation gets to know your potential and also gives you the correct exposure that you need i your formative years. Above all, we hope you get encouraged into the world of open source and develop more code for the benefit of all.

Let's Build Something Awesome Together
Developer Students Club of NSEC brings to you Winter of Code which is a month-long extravaganza of Open Source contribution, bringing together students, organisations and mentors to build amazing projects together. Here is what the program has to offer for students, organizations, and mentors.

## How does the program works illustrations

### Students

Students who are interested can register for the Winter of Code by filling a form. Students who are selected will work with mentors of the organization that they are accepted for. If accepted, students amalgamate with their organizations prior to the start of coding and learn more about their organizationâ€™s community. Students then have one month to code and meet the deadlines agreed upon with their mentors. On successful completion of the program students will be rewarded with some cool schwags.

### Organisations
Open source organizations can apply to be mentor organizations. Once accepted, organizations discuss possible ideas with students and then decide on the proposals they wish to mentor for the winter. They provide feedback to help guide each student through the program. Mentors and students work together to determine appropriate milestones and requirements for the winter. Mentor interaction is a vital part of the program.

### Mentors

Mentors guide the students throughout their projects and review their code samples multiple times. They provide valuable feedback and suggest possible improvements to the code. They also determine if a student has successfully completed the Winter of code 2020 project. Students are then notified of the pass/fail status and schwags are delivered accordingly.n
