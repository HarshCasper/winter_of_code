# Winter of Code

## About The Program

Winter of Code is a program aimed to increase participation for the Google Summer of Code program among students in colleges and universities.
Winter of Code is here to light up your winter spirits with the wide world of open source development. This initiative aims to prepare you for the grand Google Summer of Code. Join us for a month-long programming project with an open-source organization.

As a part of the Winter of Code, students are paired with mentors. This initiative aims at developing your skills in real-world software development in a wide range of specializations. In turn, the participating organisation gets to know your potential and also gives you the correct exposure that you need i your formative years. Above all, we hope you get encouraged into the world of open source and develop more code for the benefit of all.

Let's Build Something Awesome Together !!

## How does the program works

### Students

Students who are interested can register for the Winter of Code by filling a form below. Every student is eligible to participate in winter of code. They can pick any project as per their interest and contribute to it. For every pull request, mentors will assign a score. These scores will help students climb the leaderboard. On successful completion of the program students will be rewarded with some cool schwags.

### Mentors

Apart from our in-house projects, we invite people who have built a project of their own and want some contributors in it to participate in winter of code. Mentors guide the students throughout their projects and review their code samples. They provide valuable feedback and suggest possible improvements to the code. They also assign a score according to the following metric:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Difficulty</th>
    <th>Score</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Easy</td>
    <td>25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hard</td>
    <td>100</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Leaderboard
Students participating will contribute to the projects and in turn receive a score for their pull requests. These scores will be summed up and will be shown on our winter of code leaderboard. We will then have prizes for our top contributors.
